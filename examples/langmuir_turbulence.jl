# [McWilliams, J. C. et al., "Langmuir Turbulence in the ocean," Journal of Fluid Mechanics (1997)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/langmuir-turbulence-in-the-ocean/638FD0E368140E5972144348DB930A38).
#
# This example demonstrates:
#
#   * how to run large eddy simulations with surface wave effects
#     via the Craik-Leibovich approximation

using Oceananigans

# ## Model set-up
#
# To build the model, we specify the grid, Stokes drift, boundary conditions, and
# Coriolis parameter.
#
# ### Domain and numerical grid specification
#
# We create a grid with modest resolution. The grid extent is similar, but not
# exactly the same as that in McWilliams et al. (1997).

using Oceananigans.Grids

grid = RegularCartesianGrid(size=(32, 32, 48), extent=(128, 128, 96))

# ### The Stokes Drift profile
#
# The surface wave Stokes drift profile used in McWilliams et al. (1997)
# corresponds to a 'monochromatic' (that is, single-frequency) wave field with

const wavenumber = 2π / 60 # m⁻¹
nothing # hide

# and

const amplitude = 0.8 # m
nothing # hide

# The `const` declarations ensure that Stokes drift functions compile on the GPU.
# To run this example on the GPU, write `architecture = GPU()` in the constructor
# for `IncompressibleModel` below.
#
# The Stokes drift at the surface for a monochromatic, deep water wave is

using Oceananigans.Buoyancy: g_Earth

const Uˢ = amplitude^2 * wavenumber * sqrt(g_Earth * wavenumber) # m s⁻¹

# The Stokes drift profile is then,

uˢ(z) = Uˢ * exp(2wavenumber * z)
nothing # hide

# which we need for the initial condition.
#
# Note that `Oceananigans.jl` implements the Lagrangian-mean form of the Craik-Leibovich
# equations. This means `Oceananigans.jl` takes the *vertical derivative of the Stokes drift*
# as input, rather than the Stokes drift profile itself.
#
# The vertical derivative of the Stokes drift is

∂z_uˢ(z, t) = 2wavenumber * Uˢ * exp(2wavenumber * z)
nothing # hide

# Finally, we note that the time-derivative of the Stokes drift must be provided
# if the Stokes drift changes in time. In this example, the Stokes drift is constant
# and thus the time-derivative of the Stokes drift is 0.

# ### Boundary conditions
#
# At the surface at ``z=0``, McWilliams et al. (1997) impose wind stress,

Qᵘ = -3.72e-5 # m² s⁻²
nothing # hide

# and weak cooling with buoyancy flux

Qᵇ = 2.307e-9 # m³ s⁻²
nothing # hide

# Oceananigans uses "positive upward" conventions for all fluxes. In consequence,
# a negative flux at the surface drives positive velocities, and a positive flux of
# buoyancy drives cooling.
#
# The initial condition and bottom boundary condition for buoyancy
# impose a linear stratification with buoyancy frequency

N² = 1.936e-5 # s⁻²
nothing # hide

# To summarize, we impose a surface flux on ``u``,

using Oceananigans.BoundaryConditions

u_boundary_conditions = UVelocityBoundaryConditions(grid, top = BoundaryCondition(Flux, Qᵘ))
nothing # hide

# and a surface flux and bottom linear gradient on buoyancy, ``b``,

b_boundary_conditions = TracerBoundaryConditions(grid, top = BoundaryCondition(Flux, Qᵇ),
                                                       bottom = BoundaryCondition(Gradient, N²))
nothing # hide

# ### Coriolis parameter
#
# McWilliams et al. (1997) use

f = 1e-4 # s⁻¹
nothing # hide

# which is typical for mid-latitudes on Earth.

# ## Model instantiation
#
# Finally, we are ready to build the model. We use the `AnisotropicMinimumDissipation`
# model for large eddy simulation. Because our Stokes drift does not vary in ``x, y``,
# we use `UniformStokesDrift`, which expects Stokes drift functions of ``z, t`` only.

using Oceananigans.Advection
using Oceananigans.Buoyancy: BuoyancyTracer
using Oceananigans.SurfaceWaves: UniformStokesDrift

model = IncompressibleModel(
           architecture = CPU(),

)

# ## Initial conditions
#
# We make use of random noise concentrated in the upper 4 meters
# for buoyancy and velocity initial conditions,

Ξ(z) = randn() * exp(z / 4)
nothing # hide

# Our initial condition for buoyancy consists of a linear stratification, plus noise,

bᵢ(x, y, z) = N² * z + 1e-1 * Ξ(z) * N² * model.grid.Lz
nothing # hide

# The velocity initial condition in McWilliams et al. (1997) is zero *Eulerian-mean* velocity.
# This means that we must add the Stokes drift profile to the ``u`` velocity field.
# We also add noise scaled by the friction velocity to ``u`` and ``w``.

uᵢ(x, y, z) = uˢ(z) + sqrt(abs(Qᵘ)) * 1e-1 * Ξ(z)

wᵢ(x, y, z) = sqrt(abs(Qᵘ)) * 1e-1 * Ξ(z)

set!(model, u=uᵢ, w=wᵢ, b=bᵢ)
